# Genetic_Algorithm_Implementation

This Repository contains the implementation of feature selection for customer churn prediction in telecommunication sector. The dataset used is a sample kaggle dataset which is an IBM Telco Churn Dataset. 
The fitness function is a multi-objective function with a weighted sum approach. This also contains the code for comparing the GA with traditional feature selection methods such as PCA and also using the full set of features as well.
